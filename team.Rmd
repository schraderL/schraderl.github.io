  The impact of horizontal gene transfers in ants.<br>
  I am interested in the evolution of social insects and particularly in understanding the genetic basis of social insect evolution and their endosymbionts. 
In the past, I have been investigating the mechanisms of worker policing and worker reproduction in Camponotus ants.
My current research project focuses on horizontally transferred genes in ants deriving from bacteria and possible new, interesting functions of these HGTs within ants. I am using large-scale sequencing data from the Global Ant Genomics Alliance to find high-quality HGT candidates with bioinformatic methods and genomic approaches. My research tackles the question whether HGTs play a significant role in ants leading to evolutionary advances. For this, I am using RNAseq data to quantify expression of HGTs as well as molecular methods to determine the existence of high-quality HGTs.
